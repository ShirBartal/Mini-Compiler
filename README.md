# Mini-Compiler

“Mini-complier” – a program that checks for syntax mistakes (such as: unbalanced parenthesis,
comments in the code, strings, etc) in a given code, using a stack. The program also prints the
number of line in which the error occurred, and the error type (unbalanced "", unbalnced (), etc).
